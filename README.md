# Project: knight_travails
Project: Knight Travalis from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails)

## Learnings
During this project, I learned how to create a binary search tree to represent all possible moves for a chess piece from a specific starting position. I developed functions to build the tree using a breadth-first approach with n-branches, which involves creating a queue of nodes and expanding it level by level.

I also learned how to traverse the tree to find the shortest path to a given position. This involved implementing a recursive function that explores each node's branches until it finds the target position or exhausts all possibilities.

Overall, this project provided a deep dive into data structures and algorithms, and reinforced the importance of careful design and testing in software development.
